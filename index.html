 <h1>What worked well for you over the last 9 weeks that aided in your learning process?</h1> 
 <p>Google helped a lot, asking questions is something I struggle to do but everytime I do end up asking Mr.Boyer he does a great job at helping me.</p> 
 <h2>What would you change about the course?</h2> 
 <p>I enjoyed the assignment with a picture reference, I feel like it makes the assignment more understandable. But I understand why not all assignments can have those things.</p> 
 <h3>Did you learn what you expected on this course ?</h3> 
 <p>Yes. I was taught the basics of programming and I still have plenty of learning to do.</p> 
 <h4>What concepts were new to you and what concepts had you already encountered in the past?</h4> 
 <p>Almost everything. I knew about dev tools because we used to change the names of YouTube videos in middleschool using a chrome extension because we couldn't do it normally, but besides everything was pretty new to me.</p>
